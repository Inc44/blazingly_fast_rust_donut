# blazingly_fast_rust_donut

This Rust program generates a rotating donut in the terminal using ASCII art. The main mechanism involves mathematical transformations and buffer manipulations to create the illusion of a 3D object in motion.

## Running the Program

1. **Install Rust:** Ensure you have Rust installed on your system. If not, you can download it from [the official Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
2. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. **Compile and Run:** Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the command `cargo run` to compile and execute the program.

## Notes

- The rendering loop is set to run indefinitely. You can terminate the program by pressing `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.
- The program's performance may vary based on the terminal's capabilities and the system's hardware specifications.
